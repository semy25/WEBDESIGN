      Everyday people are scrambling to get to work, school or try to get parts of their life together. Rarely do we have time nowadays to take a breath and just look around to absorb our surroundings. In this generation, people are satisfied with seeing people through social media or online, even at a family gathering, people are on their phones instead of interacting with one another. Some people try to get a breather from their busy lives by meditating, baking or going shopping, I personally take a camera, go outside or set up lights to take pictures that capture both the chaos we're living in and the beauty we miss out on in life. Even through a lens, you can capture emotions that are difficult to perceive now. Portraits of people from the ages of 5 to 80, smiling, crying and laughing. You can see the look in their eyes, all captured in one photo. Landscapes of the beautiful scenery that you pass by while driving, or the hectic New York streets and the aftermath of tragedies that not everyone knows about. Images that convey such emotion, and the things that people witness and go through are what influence the future generations. What I try to do is to share a portion of these images to tell a story...
